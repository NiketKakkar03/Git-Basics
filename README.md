git is a way to track file changes in a repository. It's mostly used for code but you could use it for anything, like keeping group documents.

the collection of code for a project on git is called a repository
GitLab is a way to view and manage git online; GitHub etc do a similar thing. QSET uses GitLab
Git and GitLab aren't the same thing; GitLab is where you can nicely manage your git

pushing = pushing your changes upstream, that is the "online" version
pulling = pulling changes from upstream
